Data to be arranged like so :
SubjectID, Activity_Label, 128 readings/window, 561 features vector

Data to be retrieved from these sources : 
PersonID - subject_test.txt 
Activity_Label - activity_lables.txt 
Activity_ID - y_test.txt
128 readings/window - x_test.txt, 
561 features vector - body_acc_x_test.txt, body_gyro_x_test.txt, total_acc_x_test.txt


Process :
PersonID <- read subject_test.txt
ActivityNm <- read activity_lables.txt 
Activity_ID - read y_test.txt
windowds <- read x_test.txt
featureds <- read body_acc_x_test.txt 
remove unwanted/NULL value columns from featureds
apply colnames to featureds from features.txt

mydf<- cbind(PersonID, Activity_ID, windowds, featureds)
